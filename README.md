# Healthcare-Analytics-Predicting-favourable-outcomes-in-medical-camps

MedCamp runs 3 formats of these camps. The first and second format provides people with an instantaneous health score. The third format provides information about several health issues through various awareness stalls.

Favorable outcome:

For the first 2 formats, a favorable outcome is defined as getting a health_score, while in the third format it is defined as visiting at least a stall.
The analysis and model is to predict the chances (probability) of having a favorable outcome.
